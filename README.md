# Daily Coding Challenges

Welcome to my **Daily Coding Challenges** repository! Here, I document and solve a variety of coding challenges to enhance my problem-solving skills and broaden my technical expertise. The challenges span multiple domains such as **algorithms**, **databases**, **shell scripting**, and programming languages like **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**.

Feel free to explore, improve solutions, and even contribute your own challenges!
